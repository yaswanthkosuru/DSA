'''
heap:heap is complete binary tree we can pop element in o(1) and push element in o(1)
uses array to represent
maxheap:root is always max
minheap:root is always min
adjust from down,adjust from up,maintaining complete binary tree is important
internally use array to represent for upward traversal and lower traversal.
