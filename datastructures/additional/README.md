# Bag Data Structure

## Overview

A Bag is a collection data structure that allows for the storage of elements where duplicates are allowed. Unlike sets, bags do not enforce uniqueness among elements. Bags are often used to model situations where the frequency of items is important.

## Characteristics

- **Duplicates Allowed**: Bags can store multiple instances of the same element.
- **Unordered**: The elements in a bag are not stored in any particular order.
- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a bag can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
